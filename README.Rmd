# syn

The goal of syn is to provide two main functions:

- `syn` - generate synonyms
- `ant` - generate antonyms (needs work).

That is it.


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(syn)
## basic example code
synonyms <- syn("cool") 

# which is better? 
paste0("This is really cool!") 
# OR 
paste0("This is really ", synonyms[1:10], "!")
```
